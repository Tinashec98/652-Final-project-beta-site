    <p> Between juggling challenging course work with a busy schedule, and finding their footing in a new city, first-year graduate students at the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism said that finding a romantic partner is still a priority. <br><br>However, this is a challenging feat as partners who suite their tastes are harder to locate, they said. <br><br>According to a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted in 2019, 47% of American adults said dating is harder today than it was ten years ago.<br><br>Additionally, 15% of adults who are single and looking for a committed relationship or casual dates are dissatisfied with their dating lives.<br><br>This is the case for some of the first-year graduate students at the Merrill College.<br><br>“We’re [busy] graduate students and have all these [face]masks on,” said Markayla Brooks, 23. Brooks is a master of journalism student with an emphasis on broadcast and sports journalism.<br><br></p>

    <p>While she appreciates that school has returned to in-person classes and this allows her to meet more people, she said it is harder to gauge how old people are when half their faces are always covered and only occasionally exposed.<br><br>“Some of [these undergraduates] are 18 years old,” she said. “I wouldn’t want a younger partner.”<br><br>Brooks also said that face masks have also made it harder for her to assess a potential partner’s facial looks.<br><br>Although physical attributes are not a deal-breaker for her, she said they still matter.<br><br>“If you can make me laugh, [looks] won’t matter and you start looking cute to me,” she said. “Once you get to know a person, you start seeing them differently.”<br><br>

    <p>Like Brooks, Langston Frazier, 25, also finds it hard to decipher fellow students’ age and looks. Frazier is a master of journalism student with an emphasis on broadcast and sports journalism.<br><br>However, Frazier said that in an ideal world, he would be open to dating undergraduate students who are in their junior or senior year as compared to freshmen and sophomores.<br></p>

    <p>“If [someone] is 18 and they say, ‘My boyfriend is a graduate student and is 25,’ people would look at them weirdly,” said Frazier. <br><br>However, Frazier cannot date students because he works as an assistant golf professional for the university’s athletics department.<br><br>In this role, Frazier has supervisory responsibilities and is therefore forbidden from having consensual romantic and sexual relationships with students and subordinate staff members, according to the University of Maryland’s consensual relationships <a href="https://senate.umd.edu/system/files/resources/MeetingMaterials/05042021/FAC_Consensual_Relationships_18-19-37.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a>.<br><br></p>

    <p>This has dwindled his dating pool to include only people outside the university community, which is miniscule, given that College Park, Maryland is a town comprised of mostly college students and university staff. <br><br>As a result, Frazier has resorted to locating potential partners on online dating applications like Tinder, Hinge and Grindr — a practice popular among single people — where he can meet people from surrounding towns and cities.<br><br>NBC News <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_tcm6FUiFw" target="_blank">reports</a> that the parent company for online dating application Match saw a 12% increase in subscribers at the end of 2020. <br></p>

    <p>While single graduate students are finding it difficult to date, those who are partnered face a different set of challenges especially when in long distance relationships.<br><br>“[My boyfriend] and I have to communicate a lot more using technology and there are a lot of things that lack with communicating [online],” said DeAnna Giles, 23.

    <p>“You never know if someone meant something, or the way they said it could come off differently,” she said.<br><br>However, in the Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/" target="_blank">survey</a>, 41% of the survey participants who said dating has gotten easier pointed to technology. <br><br>Using technology as her primary form of communication has prompted Giles to communicate better, she said. <br><br></p>

    <p>“When you’re apart, you either choose to be in it 100%, or you choose to end things,” she said. “I chose to stay.”<br><br></p>
